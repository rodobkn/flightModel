## Problem

A jupyter notebook (`exploration.ipynb`) has been provided with the work of a Data Scientist (from now on, the DS). The DS, trained a model to predict the probability of **delay** for a flight taking off or landing at SCL airport. The model was trained with public and real data, below we provide you with the description of the dataset:

|Column|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|`Fecha-I`|Scheduled date and time of the flight.|
|`Vlo-I`|Scheduled flight number.|
|`Ori-I`|Programmed origin city code.|
|`Des-I`|Programmed destination city code.|
|`Emp-I`|Scheduled flight airline code.|
|`Fecha-O`|Date and time of flight operation.|
|`Vlo-O`|Flight operation number of the flight.|
|`Ori-O`|Operation origin city code.|
|`Des-O`|Operation destination city code.|
|`Emp-O`|Airline code of the operated flight.|
|`DIA`|Day of the month of flight operation.|
|`MES`|Number of the month of operation of the flight.|
|`AÃ‘O`|Year of flight operation.|
|`DIANOM`|Day of the week of flight operation.|
|`TIPOVUELO`|Type of flight, I =International, N =National.|
|`OPERA`|Name of the airline that operates.|
|`SIGLAORI`|Name city of origin.|
|`SIGLADES`|Destination city name.|

In addition, the DS considered relevant the creation of the following columns:

|Column|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|`high_season`|1 if `Date-I` is between Dec-15 and Mar-3, or Jul-15 and Jul-31, or Sep-11 and Sep-30, 0 otherwise.|
|`min_diff`|difference in minutes between `Date-O` and `Date-I`|
|`period_day`|morning (between 5:00 and 11:59), afternoon (between 12:00 and 18:59) and night (between 19:00 and 4:59), based on `Date-I`.|
|`delay`|1 if `min_diff` > 15, 0 if not.|

## Challenge

### Instructions

1. Create a repository in **github** and copy all the challenge content into it. Remember that the repository must be **public**.

2. Use the **main** branch for any official release that we should review. It is highly recommended to use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) development practices. **NOTE: do not delete your development branches.**
   
3. Please, do not change the structure of the challenge (names of folders and files).
   
4. All the documentation and explanations that you have to give us must go in the `challenge.md` file inside `docs` folder.

5. To send your challenge, you must do a `POST` request to:
    `https://advana-challenge-check-api-cr-k4hdbggvoq-uc.a.run.app/software-engineer`
    This is an example of the `body` you must send:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Juan Perez",
      "mail": "juan.perez@example.com",
      "github_url": "https://github.com/juanperez/latam-challenge.git",
      "api_url": "https://juan-perez.api"
    }
    ```

***NOTE: We recommend to send the challenge even if you didn't manage to finish all the parts.***

### Context:

We need to operationalize the data science work for the airport team. For this, we have decided to enable an `API` in which they can consult the delay prediction of a flight.

*We recommend reading the entire challenge (all its parts) before you start developing.*

### Part I

In order to operationalize the model, transcribe the `.ipynb` file into the `model.py` file:

- If you find any bug, fix it.
- The DS proposed a few models in the end. Choose the best model at your discretion, argue why. **It is not necessary to make improvements to the model.**
- Apply all the good programming practices that you consider necessary in this item.
- The model should pass the tests by running `make model-test`.

> **Note:**
> - **You cannot** remove or change the name or arguments of **provided** methods.
> - **You can** change/complete the implementation of the provided methods.
> - **You can** create the extra classes and methods you deem necessary.

### Part II

Deploy the model in an `API` with `FastAPI` using the `api.py` file.

- The `API` should pass the tests by running `make api-test`.

> **Note:** 
> - **You cannot** use other framework.

### Part III

Deploy the `API` in your favorite cloud provider (we recomend to use GCP).

- Put the `API`'s url in the `Makefile` (`line 26`).
- The `API` should pass the tests by running `make stress-test`.

> **Note:** 
> - **It is important that the API is deployed until we review the tests.**

### Part IV

We are looking for a proper `CI/CD` implementation for this development.

- Create a new folder called `.github` and copy the `workflows` folder that we provided inside it.
- Complete both `ci.yml` and `cd.yml`(consider what you did in the previous parts).


### Rodolfo Notes

In order to run the api while developing, first you need to have the virtual environment set up. Then switch to the virtual env and go to the challenge folder and run the following command:

- `uvicorn api:app --reload`

Deploy manually to google cloud

- First, from the root directory you need to run: `docker build -t fastapimodel .`

- Then run the command: `docker tag fastapimodel:latest gcr.io/delaylatammodel/fastapimodel`

In the previous command is important to notice that you need to use the exact tag that you used in the first command and `delaylatammodel` is the id of the google cloud project.

- Now run: `docker push gcr.io/delaylatammodel/fastapimodel`

With the previous command you push the image to Google Cloud Container Registry. Then, you can use that image in google cloud run and you api will be deployed. 

In this case the api was deployed in the following url: `https://fastapimodel-oedodimemq-uc.a.run.app`
